   abstract = {Assessment and management of spatial variability of soil chemical and physical properties (e.g., soil texture, organic matter, salinity, compaction, and nutrient content) are very important for precision farming. With current advances in sensing technology, soil electrical conductivity (EC) mapping is considered the most efficient and inexpensive method that can provide useful information about soil variability within agricultural fields. The objectives of this research study were to determine if Coulter and penetrometer-type EC sensors produce similar descriptions of soil variability, and if EC and cone index (CI) measured using a penetrometer-type sensor are correlated. The spatial variability of apparent EC (ECa) and penetration resistance expressed as CI for soil compaction were investigated with Coulter and penetrometer sensing technologies. The study was conducted in April 2005 at the research farm located near Williston, North Dakota, on a Lihen sandy loam (sandy, mixed, frigid Entic Haplustoll). The ECa and CI values generated by the penetrometer sensor were averaged over a 0- to 30-cm depth for comparison with values measured using the Coulter sensor over the same 0- to 30-cm depth. Classical and spatial statistics were used to evaluate spatial dependency and assess the overall soil variability within the experimental site. The statistical results indicated that the ECa data from both Coulter and penetrometer sensors exhibited similar spatial trends across the field that may be used to characterize the variability of soil for a variety of important physical and chemical properties. The coefficients of variation (CVs) of log-transformed ECa data from Coulter and penetrometer sensors were 11.3% and 18.9%, respectively. The mean difference, Md, of log-transformed ECa measurements between these two devices was also significantly different from zero (Md = 0.44 mS/m; t = 31.5, n = 134; P < 0.01). Soil ECa and CI parameters were spatially distributed and presented strong to medium spatial dependency within the mapped field area. Results from this study indicate the effectiveness of the ECa and CI sensors for identifying spatial variability of soil properties, and thus, the sensors may be useful tools for managing spatial variability in agricultural fields.

   abstract = {In Japan, several types of natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions have occurred and will likely occur in the future. Therefore, civil engineering works are required for restoration after such natural disasters, and teleoperated construction machines have been developed to facilitate such works. During the operation of teleoperated construction machines, images from various viewpoints e.g., an image from the perspective of the machines or that from the side of the bucket is essential for carrying out tasks efficiently. However, in the case of the initial response to natural disasters, it is difficult to use dedicated, conventional camera-equipped vehicles and fixed cameras on external towers to obtain such perspective images, particularly within a month after the disaster. Therefore, in this research, we propose a tether-powered multirotor micro unmanned aerial vehicle (MUAV) system to obtain images from various perspectives for the operator of a teleoperated construction machine. The features of the proposed system are (1) high voltage for transmitting electric power through thin tether, (2) tension control of the tether in vibration and inclined conditions, and (3) wired VDSL communication between the MUAV and the helipad. In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of the proposed system. In addition, we report the results of the field test of the tethered MUAV mounted on a construction machine.},

   abstract = {Lambert's model for body reflection is widely used in computer graphics. It is used extensively by rendering techniques such as radiosity and ray tracing. For several real-world objects, however, Lambert's model can prove to be a very inaccurate approximation to the body reflectance. While the brightness of a Lambertian surface is independent of viewing direction, that of a rough surface increases as the viewing direction approaches the light source direction. In this paper, a comprehensive model is developed that predicts body reflectance from rough surfaces. The surface is modeled as a collection of Lambertian facets. It is shown that such a surface is inherently non-Lambertian due to the foreshortening of the surface facets. Further, the model accounts for complex geometric and radiometric phenomena such as masking, shadowing, and interreflections between facets. Several experiments have been conducted on samples of rough diffuse surfaces, such as, plaster, sand, clay, and cloth. All these surfaces demonstrate significant deviation from Lambertian behavior. The reflectance measurements obtained are in strong agreement with the reflectance predicted by the model.},

   abstract = {Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) has been used in association with Standard Penetration Test (SPT) and Dynamic Cone Penetration Test (DCPT) for Geotechnical investigations at two sites, proposed for thermal power plants, in Uttar Pradesh (UP), India. SPT and DCPT tests were conducted at 28 points and two ERT profiles, each measuring 355 m long, were recorded using 72 electrodes deployed at 5 m spacing. Electrical characterization of subsurface soil was done using borehole data and grain size analysis of the soil samples collected from boreholes. The concept of electrical resistivity variation with soil strength related to the grain size distribution, cementation, porosity and saturation has been used to correlate the transverse resistance of soil with the number of blow counts (N-values) obtained from SPT and DCPT data. It was thus observed that the transverse resistance of soil column is linearly related with the number of blow counts (N-values) at these sites. The linear relationships are site-specific and the coefficients of linear relation are sensitive to the lithology of subsurface formation, which was verified by borehole data. The study demonstrates the usefulness of the ERT method in geotechnical investigations, which is economic, efficient and less time consuming in comparison to the other geotechnical methods, such as SPT and DCPT, used for the purpose. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {Proximal soil sensing (PSS) using portable visible-near infrared (vis-NIR: 400-2500 nm) spectrophotometers can be used to measure soil properties in situ. The objectives of this research were: (i) to compare field spectra collected in situ to spectra collected in the laboratory, (ii) to estimate soil colour and mineral composition from the spectra, and (iii) to make predictions of clay content using a spectral library that contains mostly spectra collected in the laboratory but also a smaller number of field spectra that were collected in situ. The evaluation was conducted using 10 soil profiles derived from different parent materials. Spectroscopic measurements were collected both in the field and in the laboratory at different depths, in triplicate. These spectra were compared multivariately using principal component analysis and by using wavelength specific t-tests. Except in the water absorption regions around 1400 nm and 1900 nm and in regions that are not primarily used to characterise soil mineral composition, field-collected spectra were not significantly different to spectra collected in the laboratory. Estimates of soil colour and mineral composition were made from the spectra using a continuum-removal technique and by targeting characteristic absorption features. Estimates of soil colour were derived from the spectra of each profile using the Munsell HVC and CIELab colour models. These were compared to qualitative estimates of Munsell colour made in the field. Spectroscopic estimates of soil colour were in fair agreement with Munsell book estimates, although the vis-NIR estimates tended to be somewhat darker and more yellow. Quantitative estimates of mineral composition were derived by comparing soil spectra to the spectra of pure minerals. These estimates were assessed using qualitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The characterisation of soil mineral composition by vis-NIR was effective, with good agreement between the results of this method and XRD analysis. The vis-NIR technique was less laborious than conventional XRD, did not require sample preparation and was better at detecting iron oxides. A spectral library containing 1287 laboratory-collected spectra and 74 spectra collected in situ at field conditions was used to develop partial least squares regression (PLSR) models to predict the clay content of both the field- and laboratory-collected spectra from the 10 soil profiles. Predictions of clay content from the field-collected spectra (RMSE = 7.9%) were slightly more accurate than those from the laboratory-collected spectra (RMSE = 8.3%). Extending the range of the PLSR calibrations by 'spiking' them with 74 field spectra improved the generalisation capacity of the models. PLSR with bootstrap aggregation, or bagging-PLSR (bPLSR), produced predictions of clay content for each profile with a measure of their uncertainty. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {Detecting mud hazards is a significant challenge to unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) autonomous off-road navigation. A military UGV stuck in a body of mud during a mission may need to be sacrificed or rescued, both unattractive options. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory is currently developing a daytime mud detection capability under the U.S. Army Research Laboratory Robotics Collaborative Technology Alliances program using UGV-mounted sensors. To perform robust mud detection under all conditions, we expect that multiple sensors will be necessary. A passive mud detection solution is desirable to meet future combat system requirements. To characterize the advantages and disadvantages of candidate passive sensors, outdoor data collections have been performed on wet and dry soil using visible, multispectral (including near-infrared), shortwave infrared, midwave infrared, long-wave infrared, polarization, and stereo sensors. In this paper, we examine the cues for mud detection that each of these sensors provide, along with their deficiencies, and we illustrate localizing detected mud in a world model that can used by a UGV to plan safe paths. We mostly limit our examination to mud detection during the daytime under ideal conditions: isolated wet soil surrounded by dry soil during nominal weather, i.e., no precipitation, calm wind, and near-average temperatures. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

   abstract = {Airborne hyper-spectral imaging has been proven to be an efficient means to provide new insights for the retrieval of biophysical variables. However, quantitative estimates of unbiased information derived from airborne hyperspectral measurements primarily require a correction of the anisotropic scattering properties of the land surface depicted by the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). Hitherto, angular BRDF correction methods rarely combined viewing-illumination geometry and topographic information to achieve a comprehensive understanding and quantification of the BRDF effects. This is in particular the case for forested areas, frequently underlaid by rugged topography. This paper describes a method to correct the BRDF effects of airborne hyperspectral imagery over forested areas overlying rugged topography, referred in the reminder of the paper as rugged topography-BRDF (RT-BRDF) correction. The local viewing and illumination geometry are calculated for each pixel based on the characteristics of the airborne scanner and the local topography, and these two variables are used to adapt the Ross-Thick-Maignan and Li-Transit-Reciprocal kernels in the case of rugged topography. The new BRDF model is fitted to the anisotropy of multi-line airborne hyperspectral data. The number of pixels is set at 35,000 in this study, based on a stratified random sampling method to ensure a comprehensive coverage of the viewing and illumination angles and to minimize the fitting error of the BRDF model for all bands. Based on multi-line airborne hyperspectral data acquired with the Chinese Academy of Forestry&rsquo;s LiDAR, CCD, and Hyperspectral system (CAF-LiCHy) in the Pu&rsquo;er region (China), the results applying the RT-BRDF correction are compared with results from current empirical (C, and sun-canopy-sensor (SCS) adds C (SCS+C)) and semi-physical (SCS) topographic correction methods. Both quantitative assessment and visual inspection indicate that RT-BRDF, C, and SCS+C correction methods all reduce the topographic effects. However, the RT-BRDF method appears more efficient in reducing the variability in reflectance of overlapping areas in multiple flight-lines, with the advantage of reducing the BRDF effects caused by the combination of wide field of view (FOV) airborne scanner, rugged topography, and varying solar illumination angle over long flight time. Specifically, the average decrease in coefficient of variation (CV) is 3% and 3.5% for coniferous forest and broadleaved forest, respectively. This improvement is particularly marked in the near infrared (NIR) region (i.e., &gt;750 nm). This finding opens new possible applications of airborne hyperspectral surveys over large areas.},

   abstract = {Kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance (BRDF) models have recently been widely used for mapping albedo with multiangle remote sensing data such as ASAS or temporal AVHRR sequences. An Ambrals algorithm will be used to produce global BRDF and albedo products in the coming EOS era using multiangle reflectance data from the MODIS and MISR. Its operational version currently uses a combination of Ross-Thick and Li- Sparse-Reciprocal kernels which has been validated favorably over other kernels or combinations. To further improve the ability of extrapolation of the Ambrals kernel combination with better physical sense while keeping its data-fitting ability, a new kernel, Li-Transit, is derived and suggested to replace Li-Sparse-Reciprocal kernel in next version of Ambrals. We tested the new kernel combination against the current one and a few alternatives using 29 field collected BRDF data sets. The results show similar data fitting ability and more reliable extrapolation for albedo mapping. A test is also done by using the new combination and the current one to produce temporal albedo change maps of New England of U.S.A. using AVHRR images. Presented also is our recent study on scaling effect of Helmholtz principle of reciprocity, and discussion on application of a priori knowledge in kernel- driven BRDF model inversion.},

   abstract = {The objective of this paper is to analyze the behavior of specular scattering for different soil texture fields at various soil moisture (mv) and analyze the data to retrieve the soil moisture with minimizing the effect of the soil texture. To study the soil texture effect on specular scattering 10 different soil fields were prepared on the basis of change in soil constituents (i.e., percentage of sand, silt and clay) and experiments were performed in both like polarizations (i.e., HH-polarization and VV-polarization) at various incidence angles (i.e., varying incidence angle from 25° to 70° in step of 5°). Angular response of specular scattering coefficients (σ°hh in HH-polarization and σ°hh in VV -polarization) were analyzed for different soil texture fields with varying soil moisture content whereas the surface roughness condition for all the observations were kept constant. The changes in specular scattering coefficient values were observed with the change in soil texture fields with moisture for both like polarizations. Further, copolarization ratio (P = σ°hh) study was performed and it was observed that the dependency of copolarization ratio for change in soil texture field at constant soil moisture is less prominent whereas the value of copolarization ratio is varying with variation of moisture content. This emphasizes that copolarization ratio may be minimizing the effect of soil texture while observing the soil moisture on specular direction. Regression analysis is carried out to select the best suitable incidence angle for observing the moisture and texture at C-band in specular direction and 60° incidence angle was found the best suitable incidence angle. An empirical relationship between P and mv was developed for the retrieval of mv and the obtained relationship gives a good agreement with observed mv In addition, mv was also retrieved through the Kirchhoff Approximation (SA) and a comparison was made with the retrieved results of empirical relationship. The empirical relationship outperformed the SA.},

   abstract = {This paper reviews techniques for measurement of soil strength and makes recommendationsfor suitable methods for off-road vehicle performance prediction. The cone penetrometer and bevameter were found to be the most appropriate largely because they enable measurements to be made in situ. However, even though the penetrometer is the only technique that can assess variation of soil resistance with depth, neither the cone index nor its gradient with respect to depth is uniquely related to soil cohesion or density, but varies with moisture content and structural state. Furthermore, the formation of soil bodies and compaction zones ahead of the cone effectively changes its geometry and the penetration no longer reflects the original properties of the soil. On the other hand, the bevameter technique only characterizes surface soil properties. Nevertheless, the bevameter provides the closest simulation of vehicle-terrain interaction among all the currently available techniques. The main criticism of the bevameter and also of the penetrometer is that the sizes of the penetration and grouser plates and the cones, respectively, are too small. © 1991 Silsoe Research Institute.},

The soil penetration resistance is a function of soil moisture content, soil specific weight and soil type. The soil type is characterised by means of a clay ratio which is the ratio of the clay content of the soil to the content of silt and sand. Based on the classical bearing capacity theories for strip foundations, a general cone penetration resistance equation is developed to represent the variability of cohesion and friction angle by means of soil type and moisture content. The empirical relationship is shown to give an accurate prediction of the cone penetration resistance for a wide range of soils from a loamy sand to a heavy clay (clay ratios 0.10-1.60) and over a wide spectrum of soil moisture contents from 10 to 65% w/w. © 1987.},

   abstract = {Cone index, as determined by a cone penetrometer, is frequently used as a measure of soil strength. The index is a compound parameter involving components of shear, compressive and tensile strength and soil metal friction. In order to assess the effect of soil type and condition on the relative contributions of these components to penetration resistance, the forces required to push blunt and sharp probes into two soils under a range of moisture contents and bulk densities were investigated. The maximum penetration force in homogeneous soil was not uniquely related to dry bulk density or cohesion, but varied with soil moisture content. At high and low moisture contents, the soil tended to interact with the shaft of the penetrometer thus increasing the resistance to penetration. At low moisture content, bodies of compressed soil formed in front of the probe, effectively changing the probe geometry. It was concluded that interpretation of cone index in typical layered field soils is difficult. Even in homogeneous soils, the proportion of shear, compressive and tensile components that the cone index reflects varies with soil condition. © 1977.},

   abstract = {Soil is an important environment for crop growth. Quick and accurately access to soil nutrient content information is a prerequisite for scientific fertilization. In this work, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology was applied for the classification of soil types and the measurement of soil total nitrogen (TN) content. A total of 183 soil samples collected from Shangyu City (People’s Republic of China), were scanned by a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system with a wavelength range of 874-1734 nm. The soil samples belonged to three major soil types typical of this area, including paddy soil, red soil and seashore saline soil. The successive projections algorithm (SPA) method was utilized to select effective wavelengths from the full spectrum. Pattern texture features (energy, contrast, homogeneity and entropy) were extracted from the gray-scale images at the effective wavelengths. The support vector machines (SVM) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) methods were used to establish classification and prediction models, respectively. The results showed that by using the combined data sets of effective wavelengths and texture features for modelling an optimal correct classification rate of 91.8%. could be achieved. The soil samples were first classified, then the local models were established for soil TN according to soil types, which achieved better prediction results than the general models. The overall results indicated that hyperspectral imaging technology could be used for soil type classification and soil TN determination, and data fusion combining spectral and image texture information showed advantages for the classification of soil types.},

   abstract = {The advances in the field of robotics enabled successful exploration of the Moon and Mars. Over the years, rover missions have demonstrated deployment of various scientific payloads for robotic field geology on these extra-terrestrial bodies. The success of these missions clearly emphasises the need to further advance rover technology in order to maximise scientific return. The success of future robotic surface exploration missions will depend on two key factors - autonomy and mobility on soft sandy and unstructured terrains. The main contribution of this paper is that it brings together vital information pertaining to various terrain characterisation techniques into a single article. Special care is taken in structuring the paper so that all the relevant terrain characterisation methods that have been used in past planetary exploration missions and those under consideration for future space exploration missions are covered. This paper will not only lists advantages and disadvantages of various terrain characterisation techniques but also presents the methodology for evaluating and comparing terrain characterisation techniques and provides a trade-off study of existing and potential approaches that could improve the mobility of future planetary exploration rovers. This survey shows that further advances in currently deployed technology are required in order to develop intelligent, on-board sensing systems which will detect and identify near surface and sub-surface terrain properties to enhance the mobility of rovers. © 2011 ISTVS.

   abstract = {A new field goniometer system (FIGOS) is introduced that allows in situ measurements of hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance data under natural illumination conditions. Hyperspectral bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) data sets taken with FIGOS nominally cover the spectral range between 300 and 2450 nm in 704 bands. Typical targets are smallgrowing dense and homogeneous vegetation canopies man-made surfaces and soils. Field BRDF data of a perennial ryegrass surface reveal a strong spectral variability. In the blue and red chlorophyll absorption bands BRDF effects are strong. Lesspronounced bidirectional reflectance effects are observed in the green and in most of the near-infrared range where surface reflectance is high. An anisotropy index (ANIX) defined as the ratio between the maximum and minimum bidirectional reflectance over the hemisphere is introduced as a surrogate measurement for the extent of spectral BRDF effects. The ANIX data of the ryegrass surface show a very high correlation with nadir reflectance due to multiple scattering effects. Since canopy geometry multiple scattering and BRDF effects are related these findings may help to derive canopy architecture parameters such as leaf area index (LAI) or leaf angle distribution (LAD) from remotely sensed hyperspectral BRDF data. Furthermore they show that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data are strongly biased by the spectral variability of BRDF effects. © 1999 IEEE.},

Multiple scattering and mutual shadowing are taken into account. Analytic expressions for the following quantities are found: bidirectional reflectance, radiance factor, radiance coefficient, normal, hemispherical, Bond, and physical albedos, integral phase function, phase integral, and limb-darkening profile. Scattering functions for mixtures can be calculated, as well as cor- rections for comparing experimental laboratory transmission or reflection spectra with observational planetary spectra. An expression for the scattering efficiency of an irregular particle large compared with the wavelength is derived. For closely spaced, nonopaque particles this efficiency is approximated by (1 + ado) -l, where a is t.he true absorption coefficient and Do is an effective particle diameter of the order of twice the mean particle size. For monomineralic surfaces it is shown that a = (1 - w)/wDo, where w is the single-scattering albedo and can be determined from reflectance measurements of a powder, so that a may be calculated from reflectance. This theory should be useful for interpretations of reflectance spec- troscopy of laboratory surfaces and photomerry of solar system objects. From photometric observations of a body the following may be estimated: average single-scattering albedo, average particle phase func- tion, average macroscopic slope, and porosity.},

Probably the most prevalent assumption made about diffuse reflection by computer vision researchers is that its reflected radiance distribution is described by the Lambertian model, whether the surface is rough or smooth. While computationally and mathematically a relatively simple model, in physical reality the Lambertian model is deficient in accurately describing the reflected radiance distribution for both rough and smooth nonmetallic surfaces. Recently, in computer vision diffuse reflectance models have been proposed separately for rough, and, smooth nonconducting dielectric surfaces each of these models accurately predicting salient non-Lambertian phenomena that have important bearing on computer vision methods relying upon assumptions about diffuse reflection. Together these reflectance models are complementary in their respective applicability to rough and smooth surfaces. A unified treatment is presented here detailing important deviations from Lambertian behavior for both rough and smooth surfaces. Some speculation is given as to how these separate diffuse reflectance models may be combined.},

   abstract = {A detailed quality and sensitivity analysis of hyper-spectral BRDF data, acquired under controlled laboratory conditions at the European Goniometric Facility (EGO) of the Joint Research Center, Ispra/Italy, has been performed. In regard to bidirectional reflectance measurements in the field with the FIGOS goniometer, the impact of angular data sampling, the movement of the Sun, and the Lambertian assumption of a Spectralon panel have been analyzed. An erectophile grass lawn canopy and a planophile watercress surface were chosen as main targets. A GER-3700 spectroradiometer providing hyperspectral resolution allowed for analyzing the wavelength dependency of the effects. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that in a first step a moderate resolution of 15°and 30°in zenith and azimuth, respectively, is adequate to capture the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of vegetated targets. Only in the hot spot area a higher resolution is desirable. The movement of the light source during data acquisition is found to be critical, and should be kept within ±1°source zenith angle in order to obtain homologous BRDF data sets. Due to the wavelength dependence of BRDF effects, the impact of the light source may vary significantly between different wavelength ranges. A normalization of the irradiance with the help of frequent reference measurements is recommended, and should be carried out using a panel with known BRDF characteristics. The Spectralon panel examined showed, deviations from a Lambertian panel of up to 5% and more, but obeyed Helmholtz's reciprocity law. Corresponding calibration coefficients are given for correcting the non-Lambertian behavior in field applications. Laboratory specific constraints such as' the nonparallelism and heterogeneity of the lamp are assessed and corrected where necessary and feasible. The reproducibility of the BRDF data obtained lies within 1-9% rmse, depending on target type, wavelength range, and measurement duration.},

The analytical model assumes that the surface consists of small, randomly disposed, mirror-like facets. Specular reflection from these facets plus a diffuse component due to multiple reflections and/or internal scattering are postulated as the basic mechanisms of the reflection process. The effects of shadowing and masking of facets by adjacent facets are included in the analysis. The angular distributions of reflected flux predicted by the analysis are in very good agreement with experiment for both metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Moreover, the analysis successfully predicts the off-specular maxima in the reflection distribution which are observed experimentally and which emerge as the incidence angle increases. The model thus affords a rational explanation for the off-specular peak phenomenon in terms of mutual masking and shadowing of mirror-like, specularly reflecting surface facets.},

The capture (left) happens in-situ using a mobile phone. Abstract Material appearance acquisition usually makes a trade-off between acquisition effort and richness of reflectance representation. In this paper, we instead aim for both a lightweight acquisition procedure and a rich reflectance representation simultaneously, by restricting ourselves to one, but very important, class of appearance phenomena: texture-like materials. While such materials' reflectance is generally spatially varying, they exhibit self-similarity in the sense that for any point on the texture there exist many others with similar reflectance properties. We show that the texturedness assumption allows reflectance capture using only two images of a planar sample , taken with and without a headlight flash. Our reconstruction pipeline starts with redistributing reflectance observations across the image, followed by a regularized texture statistics transfer and a non-linear optimization to fit a spatially-varying BRDF (SVBRDF) to the resulting data. The final result describes the material as spatially-varying, diffuse and specular, anisotropic reflectance over a detailed normal map. We validate the method by side-by-side and novel-view comparisons to photographs, comparing normal map resolution to sub-micron ground truth scans, as well as simulated results. Our method is robust enough to use handheld, JPEG-compressed photographs taken with a mobile phone camera and built-in flash.},

   abstract = {We provide a new presentation of the masking-shadowing functions (or geometric attenuation factors) in microfacet-based BRDFs and answer some common questions about their applications. Our main motivation is to define a correct (geometrically indicated), physically based masking function for application in microfacet models, as well as the properties that function should exhibit. Indeed, several different masking functions are often presented in the literature and making the right choice is not always obvious. We start by showing that physically based masking functions are constrained by the projected area of the visible micro-surface onto the outgoing direction. We use this property to derive the distribution of visible normals from the microsurface, whose normalization factor is the masking function. We then show how the common form of microfacet-based BRDFs emerges from this distribution. As a consequence, the masking function is related to the correct normalization of microfacet- based BRDFs. However, while the correct masking function satisfies these normalization constraints, its explicit form is can only be determined for a given microsurface profile. Our derivation emphasizes that under the assumptions of their respective microsurface profiles, both Smith's function and the V-cavity masking function are correct. However, we show that the V-cavity microsurface yields results that miss the effect of occlusion, making it analogous to the shading of a normal map instead of a displacement map. This observation explains why the V-cavity model yields incorrect glossy highlights at grazing view angles. We also review other common masking functions, which are not associated with a micro-surface profile and thus are not physically based. The insights gained from these observations motivate new research directions in the field of microfacet theory. For instance, we show that masking functions are stretch invariant and we show how this property can be used to derive the masking function for anisotropic microsurfaces in a straightforward way. We also discuss future work such as the incorporation of multiple scattering on the microsurface into BRDF models.},
